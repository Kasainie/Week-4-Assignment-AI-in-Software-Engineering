# Task 1 – AI-Powered Code Completion

## Description
Compares an AI-suggested code snippet (from Copilot/Tabnine) with a manual implementation
for sorting a list of dictionaries by a key.

## Files
- `ai_suggested_sort.py` — concise AI version.
- `manual_sort.py` — robust manual version.

## Efficiency Summary
Both have O(n log n) time complexity.
- AI version: concise, memory-efficient.
- Manual version: more robust with mixed types.

**Conclusion:** The AI-generated code is typically more efficient and readable.
