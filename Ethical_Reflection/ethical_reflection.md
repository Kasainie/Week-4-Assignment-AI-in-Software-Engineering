# Ethical Reflection â€“ Bias and Fairness in AI Models

## Potential Biases
- Underrepresentation of certain teams or issue types.
- Subjective labeling of priority levels.
- Correlation between team size and priority.

## Fairness Tools (IBM AI Fairness 360)
- Compute fairness metrics (Disparate Impact, Equal Opportunity Difference).
- Apply mitigation:
  - Pre-processing: reweighing or resampling.
  - In-processing: adversarial debiasing.
  - Post-processing: reject option classification.

Goal: Ensure model fairness without compromising accuracy.
